This script makes Dark Souls II playable on Linux when using keyboard and mouse. See the **key_bindings_screenshots** directory for the configuration used.
  
F1 = Pause/Resume script  
F4 = Exit script  
E  = O/P  
Q = 0/9  
MOUSE1 = 1  
MOUSE2 = 2  
  
Be careful when loading your save game. Use P instead of E as it could result in accidental character deletion.  
  
There are other quirks with this setup in dialogs/UI but it's tolerable and quick to get used to. No issues with combat that I could find.  
  
  
Good Luck!
